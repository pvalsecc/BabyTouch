        A toy game for babies starting from 14 months. Tested and approved by my baby.

        It\'s in fact two games:
        1) A set of animals the baby can move around and that makes noises.
        2) A drawing board with multi touch support and pressure sensitive.

        For getting out of the game, press 3 times on the &quot;back&quot; button from the main screen.

        I know that there are multiple apps like that in the Google play store, but they all have adverts or you have to pay for them.
        This one has no advertisement and is 100% free.
